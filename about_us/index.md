<h3>About us</h3>

We're part of &ldquo;America’s Data Agency,&rdquo; the Department of Commerce.

We help agencies make better decisions with data.  We provide the nuts and bolts so our partners can securely store, analyze, sort, and aggregate data in new ways. We use our private sector partners' knowledge to create new ways of using data to solve problems.  Our JV program works side-by-side with universities, nonprofits and industry professionals &mdash; together, they can experiment with data science technologies before they’re available in the marketplace.

### Our history

No other group can replicate our history and experience managing data.

Originally called the Publication Board, NTIS was created after World War II. Our original purpose was to serve as the U.S. government's repository for scientific research and information.

Now we have a new mission: to provide information and data services to the public, industry and other federal agencies in ways that enable the U.S. innovation and economic growth.  To do this, we are becoming the place in government where by working with private sector partners new and improved data products and services can be delivered through trusted data networks before they come to market.  This creates a faster pipeline for new platforms for analyzing data, using data for new products and services, and delivery of better data services to businesses, communities and citizens. 

Today, we maintain the world’s most comprehensive collection of U.S.-sponsored research. We house more than 3 million publications, and our data covers topics that range from aerodynamics to urban development. Our archive spans the Manhattan project to present.

### Our team

We believe diverse teams produce the best work, and so our projects are staffed with people inside and outside the government.

We have in-house data scientists, project managers, researchers, and engineers. Our Joint Venture Partners include private companies, nonprofits, and universities.

### Job opportunities

We’re a 200-person organization dedicated to helping government ask questions and get results — all using data.

Our mission demands data-savvy people.  We’re looking for people who speak R, Python, and D3. Who dream in Databricks, Spark, and AWS. Who believe better data insights can lead to better public services.
