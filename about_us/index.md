<h3>About us</h3>

We're part of &ldquo;America’s Data Agency,&rdquo; the Department of Commerce.

We help federal agencies securely store, analyze, sort, and aggregate data in new ways. We pair our agency partners with innovators from the private-sector using our Joint Venture Partnership program. This program lets agencies work side-by-side with universities, nonprofits and industry professionals &mdash; together, they can experiment with data science technologies before they’re available in the marketplace.

### Our history

No other group can replicate our history and experience managing data.

Originally called the Publication Board, NTIS was created after World War II. Our original purpose was to serve as the U.S. government's repository for scientific research and information.

Today, we maintain the world’s most comprehensive collection of U.S.-sponsored research. We house more than 3 million publications, and our data covers topics that range from aerodynamics to urban development. Our archive spans the Manhattan project to present.

### Our team

We believe diverse teams produce the best work, and so our projects are staffed with people inside and outside the government.

We have in-house data scientists, project managers, researchers, and engineers. Our Joint Venture Partners include private companies, nonprofits, and universities.

### Job opportunities

We’re a 200-person organization dedicated to helping government ask questions and get results — all using data.

Our mission demands data-savvy people.  We’re looking for people who speak R, Python, and D3. Who dream in Databricks, Spark, and AWS. Who believe better data insights can lead to better public services.
