    <h3>Krystal</h3>
    <h4>Chief Data Scientist</h4>
    <p><q>The opportunity to solve unique data problems for any federal agency, not just the Department of Commerce, was why I joined NTIS as a data scientist. Previously, I primarily focused on weather data, and I am excited for the challenge of working with data outside of my subject-matter expertise.  Teaming with the private sector, specifically our new Joint Venture Partners, will allow for innovation, collaboration, and the ability to stay involved with up-and-coming technologies.</q></p>

    <h3>Derssie</h3>
    <h4>Chief Data Scientist</h4>
    <p>After supporting research and software engineering at NASA, I was drawn to NTIS by the idea that I could make a difference.  Developing cutting-edge technologies for the future data mission and serving as the chief data scientist provides me with the opportunity to help shape the future of how data is used.  Every day I'm learning new ways to apply technology to solve complex data science problems.</p>
