    <h3>Krystal</h3>
    <h4>Data Scientist</h4>
    <p><q>The opportunity to solve unique data problems for any federal agency, not just the Department of Commerce, was why I joined NTIS as a Data Scientist. Previously, I primarily focused on weather data and I am excited for the challenge of working with data outside of my subject matter expertise.  Teaming with the private sector, specifically our new Joint Venture Partners, will allow for innovation, collaboration, and the ability to stay involved with up and coming technologies.</q></p>
