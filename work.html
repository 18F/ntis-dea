  <h1>How we work</h1>

    <h2>Building a new bridge between government and private sector innovation.</h2>

  <p>We solve problems by connecting government and companies to collaborate more efficiently and effectively to build next-generation solutions that can't be found anywhere else. One way we do this is through our Joint Venture Partners program.</p>
    
<p>Our unique Joint Venture authority provides us unparalled speed to market capabilities.  The NTIS joint ventures are business partnerships focused on data-focused projects.  Our partners are selected through a merit-based process and can include univerisities, non-profit and for-profit organizations.</p>
    
<h2>How it works</h2>
    
<p>Through an Interagency Agreement (IAA), we help your federal agency refine your project requirements and assess fit for our JV partner program.  We then use those requirements to make a merit-based selection of one or more of our partners.</p>
    
<p>Projects that require fast execution and innovative technologies and are not amenable to typical contract vehicles or available commercial solutions may be good candidates for the JV partner program.  We look for projects that involve the first or early use of emerging technologies, require a custom solutions, and are open agile software development. If a contract vehicle is the appropriate vehicle for a particular project we will not use a JV partner arrangement to carry out the project.</p>
