  <h1>About Us</h1>
  
  <p>
    Every year, the government sponsors billions of dollars of scientific research.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The data that comes from this research can foster innovation, stimulate the economy, 
    and lead to new jobs. But businesses, government agencies, and members of the public need to access it first.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The National Technical Information Service houses the world's most comprehensive collection 
    of U.S.-sponsored research. With more than 3 million publications, our data covers topics that range from aerodynamics to urban 
    development. Our archive spans the Manhattan project to present.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    No other group can replicate our history of managing data, and we use that institutional knowledge to help 
    federal agencies make their data public.
