      <h4>Big Data in the Federal Government</h4>
      <!-- <p>
        No question: In this Digital Age, we live in a data-driven world. Like oil was for the Industrial Age, data is the fuel of the Digital Age – powering our economy, jobs, industries, ideas, decisions, devices, lives, cities and communities, and our government.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data is a renewable natural resource that can catalyze change, leading to breakthroughs in health, safety, transportation, energy and the environment.
      </p> -->
      <p>
        The federal government is a leading source of the nation&rsquo;s Big Data. Our agencies collect, compile, assess and deliver some of the world&rsquo;s most reliable data on every conceivable aspect of our nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within the federal government, The U.S. Commerce Department is known as “America&rsquo;s Data Agency” because it delivers 40 percent of all federal data. People use Commerce data for insight into their weather and climate, their communities, and how the economy is faring, make investment and hiring decisions and warn of coming danger, position first-responders, construct high-tech classrooms, and more. The federal government uses Commerce data to allocate funds and make critical decisions on fiscal and monetary policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within Commerce, NTIS delivers the most advanced scientific and technological data in the world, known for over 100 years for its accuracy and precision. Given how data fuels today&rsquo;s world, NTIS joins the rest of government in striving to make our data easier to use&mdash;easier to combine and access different data types, standards, methodologies, websites, architecture, platforms, and formats. We’re making progress.
      </p>
      <div class="short-divider"></div>
      <h4>Joint Venture Partnerships</h4>
      <p>
        But we know government&rsquo;s Big Data vision is impossible if we make our data available only through conventional means. So NTIS is embracing public-private sector partnerships as a way to accelerate our data usability goals in ways the federal government can’t do alone efficiently and cost-effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        <!--And now, thanks to the NTIS --> Through our Joint Venture Partnerships program, we help the federal government <!--is teaming--> team up with the private sector to harness data to help our agencies run faster, better, smarter&mdash;and serve the public, our customers, even more efficiently and effectively.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        Public-private partnerships also help government develop and disseminate our data in common market standards and architectures&mdash;all to help us produce a powerful data platform and more access to public data in usable forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Government produces oceans of data every day. We want to capture and harness that data in new ways that make government work better, drive innovation, job creation, and our economy and global competitiveness, and help companies and charities succeed and drive progress for the nation. NTIS and our Joint Venture Partners bring new ways to modernize government the data-driven way.
