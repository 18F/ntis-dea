#### Private industry

We’re looking for the nation’s top private-sector companies, nonprofits, NGOs, and academic institutions. We fairly and rigorously select partners through an open competition. We like to work with partners who can:  

- Integrate public and private data
- Improve access, use, search, or interoperability of federal data
- Create suites of data products, platforms, and services
- Test new approaches to data science with real users and real data


#### Government

We look for government partners on projects that need fast execution and require innovative technologies. We look for projects that cannot be accomplished through the usual contract vehicles or existing commercial solutions. We’re interested in partnering on projects that can:

- Support Smart City initiatives
- Address environmental issues
- Lead to new data capabilities
- Develop ways to track and respond to health and safety emergencies
