    <h1>Hire Us</h1>

    <h3>Work more efficiently and effectively with NTIS. We're available for short- and long-term engagements with federal agencies.</h3>

    <p>Our team can help you define challenges and create next-generation solutions for your data publishing, data analysis, and data management projects.</p>

    <p>Our Joint Venture Partners program gives NTIS unparalleled speed-to-market capabilities. This unique authority allows us to collaborate with your team and hand pick data-service providers to fulfill your project needs.

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Joint ventures are business partnerships for data-focused projects. Our partners are selected based on merit and include universities, nonprofits, and for-profit organizations.</p>

<p>Through an Interagency Agreement (IAA), we'll help your agency refine project requirements— this ensures the Joint Venture Partners program will work for you. Once finalized, we’ll use those requirements to select one or more business partners for your project.</p>

<p>Our joint venture program works well for projects that require fast execution, that call for innovative technologies. It’s best for projects that can't be accomplished through the usual contract vehicles or with existing commercial solutions. We look for projects that involve the first or early use of emerging technologies, require a custom solutions, and will use open, agile software development.</p>
