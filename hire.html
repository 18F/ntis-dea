    <h3>Work more efficiently and effectively with NTIS. We're available for short- and long-term engagements with federal agencies.</h3>
    
    <p>Our team can help you define challenges and create next-generation solutions for your data publishing, data analysis, and data management projects.</p>
    
    <p>Through our Joint Venture Partners program, you can collaborate with our team and a data-service provider that has proven capabilities in data science.</p>
    
<h2>How it works</h2>
        
<p>Our unique Joint Venture authority provides us unparalled speed to market capabilities.  The NTIS joint ventures are business partnerships focused on data-focused projects.  Our partners are selected through a merit-based process and can include univerisities, non-profit and for-profit organizations.</p>
    
<p>Through an Interagency Agreement (IAA), we help your federal agency refine your project requirements and assess fit for our JV partner program.  We then use those requirements to make a merit-based selection of one or more of our partners.</p>
    
<p>Projects that require fast execution and innovative technologies and are not amenable to typical contract vehicles or available commercial solutions may be good candidates for the JV partner program.  We look for projects that involve the first or early use of emerging technologies, require a custom solutions, and are open agile software development. If a contract vehicle is the appropriate vehicle for a particular project we will not use a JV partner arrangement to carry out the project.</p>
