<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Joint ventures are business partnerships for data-focused projects. Our partners are selected based on merit and include universities, nonprofits, and for-profit organizations.  By partnering with the private sector, we improve the ability to government to better provide data and services in efficient means back to the public.  We expect that public-private partnerships towards new data platforms and services will lead to next generation standards for serving up data for years to come.</p>

<p>We'll help your agency determine if the Joint Venture Program is right for you.  Our Joint Venture Program works best for projects that require fast execution, require innovative technologies, and require a clear path to execution that cannot be found elsewhere. Itâ€™s best for projects that can't be accomplished through the usual contract vehicles or with existing commercial solutions. We look for projects that involve the first or early use of emerging technologies, require a custom solutions, and will use open, agile software development.</p>
