#### What we do

With the support of industry experts, we help federal agencies manage big datasets and solve big data problems.

The [Federal Big Data Research and Development Strategic Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/bigdatardstrategicplan-nitrd_final-051916.pdf) outlines a vision where cooperation between the public and private sectors leads to innovation in government.  It envisions real-time, diverse datasets being used to reduce traffic congestion, increase energy efficiency, and reduce fraud and waste for the American public.

Our projects involve just the type of public-private cooperation that the strategic plan imaginesâ€” improving access, discoverability, and usability of government research and data.

Our team works fast, in the open, and with Joint Venture Partners. We adhere to the highest privacy and security standards: We support only trusted data networks; we follow rigorous privacy and security guidelines.
