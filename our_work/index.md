### What we do

With the support of industry experts, we help federal agencies manage data and create solutions.

The [Federal Big Data Research and Development Strategic Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/bigdatardstrategicplan-nitrd_final-051916.pdf) outlines a vision where cooperation between the public and private sectors leads to innovation in government. It envisions real-time, diverse datasets being used to reduce traffic congestion, increase energy efficiency, and reduce fraud and waste for the American public.

Our projects involve just the type of public-private cooperation that the strategic plan imagines --- improving access, discoverability, and usability of government research and data.


### Our process

Our process begins with you. Our team works fast, in the open, and with Joint Venture Partners. Together we'll build a new product or service. We'll work with you to continuously improve it until it meets your needs. 

For agencies, the process looks something like this:

1. You identify a need, and we review it. We start to identify partners.
2. We work with you to develop objectives and evaluation criteria.
3. We work with our partners prepare a response to the objectives and evaluation criteria. This can include oral presentations and demonstrations.
4. We present the project to our advisory board.  If approved, we notify your team and develop a project plan.
5. Paperwork is signed, and funds are obligated. Work begins.
