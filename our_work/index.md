### What we do

With the support of industry experts, we help federal agencies manage data and create solutions.

The [Federal Big Data Research and Development Strategic Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/bigdatardstrategicplan-nitrd_final-051916.pdf) outlines a vision where cooperation between the public and private sectors leads to innovation in government. It envisions real-time, diverse datasets being used to reduce traffic congestion, increase energy efficiency, and reduce fraud and waste for the American public.

Our projects involve just the type of public-private cooperation that the strategic plan imagines --- improving access, discoverability, and usability of government research and data.


### Our process

Our process begins with you. Our team works fast, in the open, and with Joint Venture Partners. Together we'll build a new product or service. We'll work with you to continuously improve it until it meets your needs. In this public-private partnership, we adhere to the highest privacy and security standards: We support only trusted data networks; we follow rigorous privacy and security guidelines.
