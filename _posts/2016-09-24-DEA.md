The DEA maintains a list of people and organizations certified to handle controlled substances and chemicals used to produce over-the-counter drugs. Clinics, health insurance companies, HMOs, and pharmaceutical companies need to access that information regularly and quickly. Our team [made that data available](https://www.ntis.gov/products/dea/) and manages its subscriber base.
