case-challenge: Manage, distribute, and update large datasets. Prevent fraud and abuse.
---


The Social Security Administration’s [Death Master File](https://dmf.ntis.gov/) is used by credit card companies and other businesses to detect fraud and abuse and determine eligibility for products and services. Distributing and updating datasets --- especially ones with vetted subscriber lists --- can be cumbersome and expensive. Our team maintains the master file and processes new applicants requesting access to the data.
